# XCrawl Classics System
This is a work-in-progress Foundry VTT module that modifies the DCC game system so it supports the Xcrawl Classics ruleset. Most of the module intended functionality is already implemented and it can be used together with the xcc-core-book module to fully enjoy XCrawl in Foundry VTT.

# What is missing?
* ~~Importing characters from the Purple Sorcerer website is not yet supported,~~ Purple Sorcerer import is now supported!
* The module doesn't yet work properly without the xcc-core-book module,
* Mojo is based on (and requires enabling) the DCC System Fleeting Luck setting,
* The beta-testing is in progress, so bugs and frequent patches are to be expected.


# For developers
* Create PRs, and then merge to main
* Once ready for a release, update the version.txt file with a new version number
* Action will run to create a draft release here: https://github.com/foundryvtt-dcc/xcc/releases
* Edit the draft release with release notes
* Publish the draft release, and it will automatically deploy to FoundryVTT.com for people to install
